# Everyone is John
 A tracking tool for the "Everyone is John" roleplaying game

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/Everyone-is-John-Tracker/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/Everyone-is-John-Tracker/actions)

## Game rules
For an extensive list of game rules as well a more in-depth guide on how to play, [check out the rulebook here](https://rulebook.io/games/everyone-is-john/rules/).

You play a man named John. One player is the Game Master and all else are voices in John's head.
Each turn you wager "Willpoints" to take control of John. Each voice has multiple skills and one obsession.
The aim is to complete your obsession as many times as you can. The harder your obsession, the higher its level (Level 1 to 3).
Each time you achieve your obsession, you earn points equal to the level.

As you play, you can use your skills to aid in the narrative of your actions. Skills may include being a smooth-talker, or someone who can cook a delicious meal. Your skills will aid you in achieving your goal.

The game is played with a single die. You may use Willpoints to increase the odds in your favour, should you need to.

# VERSION 2 WORK IN PROGRESS
